Continue working on the existing market-ready Dream Creation system.
Do NOT change any UI, layout, labels, dropdown design, spacing, or theme.
Only update recurrence logic, date calculations, and task generation so the behavior matches real-world expectations and is APK/production safe.

1️⃣ RECURRENCE TERMINOLOGY UPDATE (IMPORTANT)

Replace recurrence options internally (logic only) as follows:

❌ Remove:

bi-weekly

bi-monthly

✅ Use instead:

semi-weekly

semi-monthly

⚠️ UI text must remain unchanged if already mapped
⚠️ Only logic & internal naming should be corrected

2️⃣ CORRECT REAL-WORLD RECURRENCE MEANING (MANDATORY)
✅ Recurrence definitions to implement
Recurrence	Correct Meaning (REAL LIFE)
daily	Every day (+1 day)
weekly	Once per week (+7 days)
semi-weekly	Twice per week (every ~3–4 days)
monthly	Once per calendar month
semi-monthly	Twice per month (1st half & 2nd half)

❌ Do NOT treat semi-weekly as 14 days
❌ Do NOT treat semi-monthly as 2 months

3️⃣ FIX CURRENT BUG (CRITICAL)
❌ Current issue:

Selecting 1 week duration

Generates 8 tasks ❌ (incorrect)

✅ Correct behavior:

weekly + 1 week → 1 task

semi-weekly + 1 week → 2 tasks

daily + 1 week → 7 tasks

👉 Task count must always match:

(task frequency) × (duration window)


No over-generation.

4️⃣ DATE CALCULATION RULES (IMPLEMENT EXACTLY)
🔹 BASE INTERVAL RULES
Recurrence	Interval Logic
daily	+1 day
weekly	+7 days
semi-weekly	Split week into 2 → +3 days, then +4 days
monthly	+1 calendar month
semi-monthly	2 fixed points per month (see below)
🔹 SEMI-WEEKLY DATE LOGIC (IMPORTANT)

Generate 2 tasks per week

First task = Start Date

Second task = Start Date + 3 or 4 days

Alternate 3 / 4 to avoid drift

Never exceed duration end date

🔹 SEMI-MONTHLY DATE LOGIC (IMPORTANT)

Use calendar-based approach, not day math:

Two tasks per month:

First half → around 15th

Second half → around last day of month

If start date is after mid-month:

Generate only remaining valid task(s)

Respect month length (28–31 days)

5️⃣ EDGE CASE HANDLING (PRODUCTION READY)
✅ Month Length

31st → Feb → clamp to 28/29

Always pick last valid day

✅ Leap Year

Feb 29 only in leap years

No fake dates

✅ Duration Cutoff

Never generate tasks beyond duration end

Final task date ≤ calculated end date

✅ Timezone Safety

Use date-only logic

Normalize to local midnight

No UTC drift

6️⃣ TASK GENERATION RULES

Each generated task must:

Have a unique assigned date

Be editable by user

Default completionStatus = false

Be linked to correct dream & user

No hardcoded task counts.

7️⃣ STRICT CONSTRAINTS

❌ Do NOT change UI
❌ Do NOT rename dropdown labels visually
❌ Do NOT break existing dreams
❌ Do NOT affect personal vs group separation

✅ Logic-only patch
✅ Backward compatible
✅ Multi-user safe
✅ APK safe

8️⃣ FINAL GOAL

After this update:

Weekly = correct task count

Semi-weekly / semi-monthly behave like real life

No over-generation bugs

Dream system is market-ready for APK & Play Store
