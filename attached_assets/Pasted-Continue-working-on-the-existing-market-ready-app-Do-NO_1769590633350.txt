Continue working on the existing market-ready app.
Do NOT change any UI, layout, colors, spacing, typography, or theme.
Only update logic, validation, and backend behavior for Dream Creation & Tasks.

1️⃣ DREAM CREATION FIELDS (STRICT)

Implement or validate the following fields:

1. Dream Name

Text input

Max length: 24 characters

Allowed: text, numbers, special characters

Required

2. Dream Description

Text input

Max length: 60 characters

Allowed: text, numbers, special characters

Optional

3. Duration

Positive integer input only

Unit dropdown:

days

weeks

months

years

4. Re-occurrence

Dropdown values:

daily

weekly

bi-weekly

monthly

bi-monthly

5. Start Date

Calendar date picker

Past dates not allowed

Required

2️⃣ TASK AUTO-GENERATION (MANDATORY)

Automatically generate N tasks based on:

Duration value

Duration unit

Re-occurrence type

Start Date

Each task must:

Have an auto-assigned date

Have an editable task text field (blank by default)

Tasks must stop exactly at the duration end.

3️⃣ TASK INPUT BEHAVIOR

User can fill only the first task text

Provide option: “Apply first task to all”

Copies first task text to all remaining tasks

Users can still manually edit any task afterward

4️⃣ DATE CALCULATION FORMULA TABLE (IMPLEMENT EXACTLY)
🔹 BASE INTERVAL (per re-occurrence)
Re-occurrence	Interval Rule
daily	+1 day
weekly	+7 days
bi-weekly	+14 days
monthly	+1 calendar month
bi-monthly	+2 calendar months
🔹 DURATION LIMIT (stop condition)
Duration Unit	End Rule
days	startDate + N days
weeks	startDate + (N × 7) days
months	startDate + N calendar months
years	startDate + N calendar years

Tasks must not exceed the calculated end date.

5️⃣ EDGE-CASE HANDLING (CRITICAL)
✅ Month Length Differences

If start date is 29th / 30th / 31st

And target month has fewer days:

Use last valid day of that month

Example:

Jan 31 → Feb task = Feb 28 (or Feb 29 in leap year)

✅ Leap Year Handling

February must respect leap years

Feb 29 only exists in leap years

Use standard Gregorian calendar rules

✅ Bi-Weekly Drift Prevention

Bi-weekly tasks must:

Always be exactly 14 days apart

Never realign to calendar weeks

Avoid cumulative drift

✅ Timezone Safety

Use date-only logic (no time offsets)

Normalize all dates to local midnight

Avoid UTC conversion bugs

6️⃣ BACKEND & DATA RULES

No hardcoded task counts

Tasks stored per user

Each task must store:

dreamId

taskDate

taskText

completionStatus (default: false)

Validate all inputs before saving

Handle invalid combinations gracefully (no crashes)

7️⃣ STRICT CONSTRAINTS

❌ Do NOT change UI
❌ Do NOT redesign screens
❌ Do NOT mix personal & group dreams
❌ Do NOT mock backend logic

✅ Logic-only update
✅ Multi-user safe
✅ APK-safe
✅ Market-ready

8️⃣ FINAL GOAL

After this patch:

Dream creation works for all valid combinations

Task dates are correct, predictable, and stable

Edge cases are handled cleanly

App remains production-ready
