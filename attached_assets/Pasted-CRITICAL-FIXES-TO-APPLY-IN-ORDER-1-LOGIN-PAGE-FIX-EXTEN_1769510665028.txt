CRITICAL FIXES TO APPLY (IN ORDER)
1️⃣ LOGIN PAGE – FIX & EXTEND
Add missing login methods:

✅ Google Login (OAuth)

✅ Facebook Login (OAuth)

Add Forgot Credentials flow:

“Forgot Password?” → Email-based password reset

Secure token-based reset

Works for every real user

Rules:

❌ No dummy emails

❌ No console-only logic

❌ No fake success messages

2️⃣ AUTHENTICATION BACKEND (MANDATORY)

Replace any hardcoded user data

Implement:

JWT access token

Refresh token

Secure password hashing

Store users in database:

id

email

auth_provider (email / google / facebook)

profile data

Each user must log in independently.

3️⃣ HEADER ICONS – MAKE THEM REAL

All header icons (⚙️ 🔔 💬 📧 💰 etc.) must:

Navigate to real screens

Fetch real backend data

Show user-specific content only

❌ No placeholder screens
❌ No “coming soon” pages

4️⃣ MESSAGES MODULE – FIX COMPLETELY
Problems to fix:

“Mark all as read” does nothing

Clicking a chat does not open messages

Required behavior:

Clicking a chat → opens full conversation

Messages stored per user in database

Read/unread state tracked

Real-time updates using WebSockets

5️⃣ MY REAL DREAM – LOGIC CORRECTION
CRITICAL BUG:

Personal & Group flows are mixed.

FIX:

Personal RealDream

Only personal fields

No group/team inputs

Group RealDream

Team members required

Group permissions enabled

🚫 NEVER show group fields in personal flow
🚫 NEVER show personal-only fields in group flow

6️⃣ FORGOT CREDENTIALS – FULL FLOW

Implement:

Forgot password

Email verification

Token expiry

Secure reset

This must work in real life, not simulated.

7️⃣ REMOVE ALL HARDCODED DATA

Audit and remove:

Hardcoded user IDs

Static message arrays

Fake notifications

UI-only counters

Replace everything with:

Database calls

API endpoints

Auth-protected routes

8️⃣ UI THEME (DO NOT CHANGE)

Keep the exact theme from screenshots provided

Colors, gradients, layout must remain

Only logic and backend should change

9️⃣ APP MUST BE STORE-READY

Final output must:

Build for Android & iOS

Use environment variables

Support production deployment

Pass Play Store & App Store review basics

🚨 VERY IMPORTANT INSTRUCTION TO REPLIT AI

Do NOT regenerate UI.
Do NOT simplify features.
Do NOT mock backend.
Modify the existing codebase only.
If something is broken, fix it properly.
