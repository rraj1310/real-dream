Context

This is a fully functional, market-ready mobile app with:

Real backend & database

Working authentication (Email/Username, Google, Phone, Facebook)

Correct dream & task logic

No hardcoded data

⚠️ Do NOT change any UI, screens, logic, or features.
Only prepare the project so that a production-grade Android APK can be generated and published.

1️⃣ Prepare App for PRODUCTION BUILD (MANDATORY)

Ensure the project is configured for Expo EAS production APK:

App must run without errors using:

npx expo start


App must not depend on Expo Go–only APIs

No debug-only code, logs, or dev flags

2️⃣ Expo Configuration (NO UI CHANGE)

Verify and ensure:

app.config.js is valid and clean

extra.eas.projectId is correctly set

Android package name is fixed and unique

App version and build number are set for release

All required Expo plugins are declared

Do NOT remove existing plugins.

3️⃣ Environment Variables (PRODUCTION SAFE)

Ensure all required environment variables use:

EXPO_PUBLIC_*


No secrets hardcoded in code

App must not crash if env is missing (graceful error handling)

4️⃣ Authentication & Backend Safety

Confirm:

Auth flows work in production builds

Google / Facebook / Phone auth use production credentials

Backend endpoints are real and not mocked

Each user sees only their own data

5️⃣ Build Configuration (IMPORTANT)

Prepare the project so it can generate a release APK using:

npx eas build --platform android --profile production


Requirements:

Production keystore generation enabled

No debug/dev client flags

No emulator-only assumptions

6️⃣ APK QUALITY CHECKS

Before final build, ensure:

App opens without crashing

Login & signup work

Dream creation & tasks work

No console errors on launch

App handles offline state gracefully

7️⃣ STRICT CONSTRAINTS

❌ Do NOT redesign UI
❌ Do NOT refactor logic
❌ Do NOT change feature behavior
❌ Do NOT downgrade dependencies

✅ Only optimize for APK release & stability
✅ Follow Android production best practices
