# Unable to Access Figma Link

I cannot access external links or view Figma files directly. To generate comprehensive design guidelines for your app, I need you to provide information about the design in text format.

## Please Share:

**1. App Purpose & Features**
- What does the app do?
- What are the main screens/features?
- Who is the target user?

**2. Visual Design Details**
- Color palette (hex codes if available)
- Typography choices (font families, sizes)
- Overall aesthetic/mood (minimalist, playful, professional, etc.)

**3. Screen Structure**
- List of main screens
- Navigation pattern (tabs, drawer, stack-based)
- Key UI components used

**4. Any Specific Design Patterns**
- Button styles
- Card designs
- Icon system
- Spacing/layout preferences

**5. Brand Elements**
- App name
- Key visual elements or illustrations
- Any unique design characteristics

Once you provide this information as text, I'll generate comprehensive design guidelines that an engineer can use to build your app exactly as you envision it.

**Alternative**: You can also describe what you see in the Figma file, or copy/paste any design specifications or notes from the Figma document.
